# Channel Auto-Post Bot

Use the usermode branch, if you want to forward messages without being an admin in the from channel.

This bot can send all new messages from one channel, directly to another channel (or group, just in case), without the forwarded tag!

## Setting up Vars
* First:
> `APP_ID` and `API_HASH` - Get it from my.telegram.org   
> `BOT_TOKEN` - Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)   
> `FROM_CHANNEL` - The ID of the main channel from where posts have to be copied. (Use @chnlidbot to get it.)   
> `TO_CHANNEL` - The ID of the channel to which the posts are to be sent. (Use @chnlidbot to get it.)
